# Wordle

Wordle is a web-based word game. Players have up to 6 chances to guess the five-letter word of the day and are given feedback for each guess in the form of colored tiles.

## Rules/Instructions

1. Begin typing a five-letter word. When you are ready to make a guess, hit the 'Enter' button.
2. Different coloured tiles will appear based on your guess.
    - If the box turns green ðŸŸ©, that letter is in the daily word and is in the correct spot.
    - If the box turns yellow ðŸŸ¨, the letter is in the word but is in the wrong position.
    - If the box turns grey â¬œ, the letter is not in the word.
3. Continue making guesses based on the feedback until you get the word of the day or run out of guesses.
