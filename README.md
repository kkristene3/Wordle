# Wordle

This project is an online copy of the New York Times game Wordle. The technologies used are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It includes all the game functionalities of the original game, but is meant to be replayable with no user accounts, success stats or replay timeout.
Wordle is a web-based word game. Players have **up to 6 guess** to determine the five-letter word of the day and are given feedback for each guess in the form of colored tiles.

## Rules & Instructions

1. Begin typing a five-letter word. When you are ready to make a guess, hit the 'Enter' button on your keyboard.
2. Different coloured tiles will appear based on your guess.

| Tile Colour | Meaning of Colour
| :---: | ---
| ðŸŸ© | If the tile turns *green*, that letter is **in the word** and is in the **correct spot**. 
| ðŸŸ¨    | If the tile turns *yellow*, the letter is **in the word** but is in the **wrong position**. 
| â¬œ | If the tile turns *grey*, the letter is **not in the word**.
3. Continue making guesses based on the feedback you receive until you either get the word of the day or  run out of guesses.
